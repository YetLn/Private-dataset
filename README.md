1.This is a private dataset comprising 10,231 traffic sign images across five categories: prohibition signs, warning signs, text-based directional signs, simplified directional signs, and auxiliary signs. Among these, 2,084 images originate from the CCTSDB2017 dataset, while 8,147 were independently collected. Each image represents different category examples, classified according to traffic regulations. The full dataset contains 3,270 warning signs, 7,464 prohibition signs, 7,255 complex directional signs with text, 5,145 simple directional signs, and 1,621 auxiliary signs. Image resolutions range from 640×480 to 1440×2553, covering diverse weather, lighting, and occlusion conditions.

2.As of the date for paper revisions(Dec.12th 2025) the dataset comprised 10,231 images with corresponding annotations (missing ID 09291).The dataset will be expanded to approximately 20,000 images at irregular intervals in the future.

3.This dataset was annotated entirely using the YOLO annotation mode within the LabelMe software, categorised into five classes. For detailed specifications, please refer to the accompanying DOCX document. To view the annotations, after configuring the image path and annotation file path within LabelMe, ensure you include the classes.txt file.

4.As GitHub repositories can only display the first 1,000 files within a single folder, all files have been deployed separately. This does not affect practical usage.

5.For further examples of the dataset and annotation details, please refer to the file labels instruction.docx.

6.Additional precautions will be updated periodically.
